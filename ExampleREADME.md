# Project Title: Homepage CWV Performance Improvement

## Overview
This project aims to improve the Core Web Vitals (CWV) performance of our homepage. Enhancing CWV metrics will lead to a better user experience and potentially improve search engine rankings.

## Background and Motivation
Our homepage currently underperforms in CWV metrics, particularly in Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). This project is motivated by the need to provide a faster, more stable user experience.

## Goals and Non-Goals
### Goals
- Reduce LCP to under 2.5 seconds.
- Achieve a CLS score of less than 0.1.
- Improve First Input Delay (FID) to under 100 milliseconds.

### Non-Goals
- Redesign the entire homepage.
- Addressing performance issues not related to CWV.

## Detailed Design
### System Architecture
The homepage consists of several components including the header, main content area, and footer. Optimization will focus on reducing render-blocking resources and lazy loading images.

### Components
#### Header
- Optimize CSS delivery.
- Defer non-critical JavaScript.

#### Main Content Area
- Lazy load images and videos.
- Optimize font loading.

#### Footer
- Minimize third-party scripts.

### Data Models
No changes to the current data models are required.

### APIs
No new APIs are introduced. Existing endpoints will be optimized for faster response times.

### User Interface
The visual design will remain unchanged. Improvements will focus solely on performance enhancements.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Audit current performance metrics.
2. Optimize CSS and JavaScript delivery.
3. Implement lazy loading for images and videos.
4. Monitor and validate improvements using performance tools.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Changes might break existing functionality.
    - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing on a staging environment.
- **Risk**: Third-party scripts affecting performance.
    - **Mitigation**: Evaluate and optimize or remove unnecessary scripts.

## Testing Strategy
- Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance audits.
- Conduct user testing to ensure no regressions in functionality.
- Monitor real user metrics post-deployment.

## Dependencies
- React
- Webpack
- Lighthouse
- WebPageTest

## Timeline
- Week 1: Performance audit and baseline metrics collection.
- Week 2-3: Implement optimizations.
- Week 4: Testing and validation.
- Week 5: Deployment and monitoring.

## Conclusion
Improving the homepage's CWV performance is critical for enhancing user experience and search engine rankings. This design doc outlines a clear plan to achieve our performance goals within a defined timeline.
